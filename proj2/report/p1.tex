\section{Eye Diagram for a Digital Communication Channel}

\subsection{Eye diagram}



\subsection{\code{c5ce2.m}: explanation}
Here follows a thoroughly commented version of the provided \code{c5ce2.m} MATLAB script.
The code below generates and plots the eye diagrams of four band-limited signals composed of random sequences of bits.
